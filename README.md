# Logisfera Nova DEV-TEST
In this repository there are 3 tasks provided by recruitment team of the Logisfera Nova devs. Tasks can be found [here](https://github.com/lsnova/dev-test)
.iml file to open project in Intellij is provided
To open and run the tasks user needs to provide relative (to where he/she is running the code) path to config.txt file in args
If the path is not provided or the file does not exist - default values will be set
If you don't want to provide the path - pass empty string 
For me the path was: 
```bash
\\src\\pl\\szulkowsky\\taskX\\config.txt
```
where X is the number of the task

In the configuration file user can choose if he/she wants to read/write from/to the file
In the configuration of the Task2 user can choose the sum of nombers in pair - default set to 13 as in the tasks description

By putting # at the beginning of the line in config file you can comment a line. Also you cannot use spaces nest to equal sign.

If you have any questions, e-mail or call me.
